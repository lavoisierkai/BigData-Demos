# Databricks Data Engineering & Analytics Demo

This demo showcases modern data engineering and analytics using Databricks platform with Delta Lake, MLflow, and advanced Spark capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

```
Data Sources → Bronze Layer → Silver Layer → Gold Layer → ML Models & Analytics
```

### Delta Lake Architecture (Medallion)
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion with schema evolution
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and validated data with quality checks
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready aggregated datasets
- **ML Layer**: Feature engineering and model training

### Technologies Demonstrated
- **Delta Lake**: ACID transactions, time travel, schema evolution
- **MLflow**: Experiment tracking, model versioning, deployment
- **Structured Streaming**: Real-time data processing
- **Unity Catalog**: Data governance and lineage
- **Databricks SQL**: Business intelligence and visualization

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Medallion Architecture (`Medallion_layers/`)
- `01_data_ingestion_bronze.py` - Raw data ingestion patterns with schema evolution
- `02_data_quality_silver.py` - Data validation, cleaning, and quality checks
- `03_business_intelligence_gold.py` - Business aggregations and KPIs

### 2. Delta Live Tables (`dlt_for_kafka/`)
- `dlt_pipeline.py` - Real-time streaming with Kafka integration
- Demonstrates continuous data processing with DLT

**Note**: This demonstrates core Databricks data engineering patterns. The current implementation includes the medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) and Delta Live Tables for streaming. For a comprehensive enterprise setup, additional notebooks would include:

- Machine Learning Pipeline (Feature engineering, model training, MLflow integration)
- Advanced Analytics (Graph processing, streaming analytics, time series)
- Data Governance (Unity Catalog integration, lineage tracking)

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Databricks Workspace**
   - Create a Databricks workspace
   - Configure cluster with Delta Lake runtime
   - Install required libraries

2. **Import Notebooks**
   - Import all `.py` notebooks to Databricks workspace
   - Attach to compute cluster

3. **Configure Data Sources**
   - Update connection strings and paths
   - Set up Unity Catalog (optional)

4. **Run Notebooks in Sequence**
   - Execute notebooks 01-08 in order
   - Each notebook creates data for the next

## Use Cases Demonstrated

1. **E-commerce Analytics**: Customer lifetime value, churn prediction
2. **Financial Risk**: Real-time fraud detection, regulatory reporting  
3. **IoT Analytics**: Sensor data processing, predictive maintenance
4. **Marketing Analytics**: Attribution modeling, campaign optimization

## Key Features Showcased

- **ACID Transactions**: Reliable data updates
- **Time Travel**: Historical data queries
- **Schema Evolution**: Automatic schema changes
- **Data Lineage**: Track data flow and transformations
- **Auto Optimization**: Automatic table optimization
- **Real-time Processing**: Streaming and batch unified
