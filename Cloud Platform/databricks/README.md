# Databricks Data Engineering & Analytics Demo

This demo showcases modern data engineering and analytics using Databricks platform with Delta Lake, MLflow, and advanced Spark capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

```
Data Sources → Bronze Layer → Silver Layer → Gold Layer → ML Models & Analytics
```

### Delta Lake Architecture (Medallion)
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion with schema evolution
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and validated data with quality checks
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready aggregated datasets
- **ML Layer**: Feature engineering and model training

### Technologies Demonstrated
- **Delta Lake**: ACID transactions, time travel, schema evolution
- **MLflow**: Experiment tracking, model versioning, deployment
- **Structured Streaming**: Real-time data processing
- **Unity Catalog**: Data governance and lineage
- **Databricks SQL**: Business intelligence and visualization
